## Project Overview

The "Participant Directory" project is designed to showcase the profiles of futureproofed participants to an online audience. This platform allows users to view detailed information about each participant, including their professional summaries and photos. It is ideal for organizations or groups that need to present member information in an accessible and visually appealing format.

## Project Structure and Technologies

### Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which provides a robust framework for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Used for managing dependencies and running scripts to build and develop the application.
- **GitHub Pages**: The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it easy to deploy and share.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows handle the conversion of participant data from CSV to JSON format, ensuring the React app always displays the latest information.
- **Python**: Utilized for scripts that process data files (e.g., converting `.docx` to text and CSV to JSON).
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and improved developer experience in the React application.

### Project Structure
Here is an overview of the project structure, highlighting the key important files and directories:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitattributes
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ build
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

### Folder Structure
- **`.gitattributes`**: Git attributes file, used to manage path-specific settings.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation file. (This File!)
- **`build/`**: Contains the production build of the app, including static assets.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Describes the exact tree that was generated by npm.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- **`public/`**: Contains public assets and the HTML file.
- **`src/`**: Contains source code for the React application.
  - `data/`: Data folder for participant data.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file.

These are the key important files and directories in the project. They are highlighted here to help you understand the project's structure and where to find essential components and configuration settings.

## User Guide

### Adding or Updating Participants

To add or update participant information, follow these steps:

#### Update the CSV File
1. Navigate to `src/data/participants.csv`.
2. Open the file in a spreadsheet editor (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets).
3. Ensure the CSV file contains the following columns: `id`, `name`, `certification`, `summary`, `linkedin`, `github`, `photo`.
4. The `summary` column must be filled in, and the `photo` column should be left blank (it will be populated by the script).
5. Save the updated CSV file.

#### Add or Update Photos
1. Place the participantâ€™s photo in the `src/data/cohort_2/` folder.
2. The photo should be in JPEG or PNG format and named using snake_case, all lowercase (e.g., `john_doe.jpg` or `jane_smith.png`).

##### Example Folder Structure:
```
src/data/cohort_2/
  - john_doe.jpg
  - jane_smith.png
```

#### Commit and Push Changes
1. After updating the CSV file and adding any new photos, commit the changes and push them to the repository. GitHub Actions will automatically convert the updated CSV to JSON and deploy the changes.

### Deleting Participants

To delete a participant:

1. **Remove from CSV**:
   - Delete the participant's entry from `src/data/participants.csv`.

2. **Delete the Participant's Photo**:
   - Remove the participant's photo from the `src/data/cohort_2/` folder.

3. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   - Commit the changes and push them to the repository. GitHub Actions will handle the rest.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to automate the process of updating the participant directory. Here's how it works:

1. **Trigger**: The workflow is triggered every time changes are pushed to the repository.
2. **CSV to JSON Conversion**:
    - The `csv_to_json.py` script reads the updated `participants.csv` file and converts the participant data into a JSON format.
3. **Extract Summaries and Photos**:
    - The `convert_docx_to_txt.py` script processes `.docx` files in the participant folders (if they exist) to extract professional summaries. These summaries are then included in the JSON data.
    - The script also ensures that the `photo` field in the JSON data is populated with the correct file path of the participant's photo.
4. **Generate `students.json`**:
    - The final JSON data is compiled into a `students.json` file, which includes all the participant details such as ID, name, certification, summary, LinkedIn, GitHub, and photo URL.
5. **Deploy**:
    - The workflow ensures the `students.json` file is placed in the appropriate location where the React app can fetch it.
    - The React app then uses this JSON file to display the participant directory on the web page.

By automating these steps, GitHub Actions ensures that every update to the participant data is processed and deployed correctly without manual intervention. This streamlined workflow keeps the participant directory up-to-date with the latest information.

### Taking Down the Site

If you need to take the site offline, make the repository private. This action will effectively remove the GitHub Pages site.

#### Steps to Make Repository Private:

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. **Open Settings**: Click on the `Settings` tab.
3. **Danger Zone**: Scroll down to the `Danger Zone` section.
4. **Change Visibility**: Click on `Change repository visibility`, then select `Make private`.
5. **Confirm**: Confirm your choice when prompted.

## Important Notes

- **CSV Columns**: Ensure the CSV file includes the following columns: `id`, `name`, `certification`, `summary`, `linkedin`, `github`, `photo`.
  - The `summary` field must be filled in.
  - The `photo` field should be left blank; it will be populated by the script.
- **File Naming**: Photos must be named in snake_case, all lowercase, to match the participant's name in the CSV file.
  
By following these instructions, you can manage the participant information efficiently, update summaries and photos, and take the site down if necessary. This project leverages modern web technologies to provide an easy-to-maintain and visually appealing directory of participants.
